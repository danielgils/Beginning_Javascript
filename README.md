In this folder I have the examples of the book *Beginning JavaScript* that I used to learn *Javascript*. In some cases I added some comments or changed the script to explore how things work.

The book is https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-JavaScript-Jeremy-McPeak/dp/1118903331

The website of the book is http://beginningjs.com/
